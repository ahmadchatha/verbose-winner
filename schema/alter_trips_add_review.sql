My driver was 10 minutes late, which I could forgive (traffic is traffic), but he was also extremely rude and his car was dirty.  If I want to deal with that kind of attitude, I''ll just take a taxi.  You really need to talk to your drivers abaout thd importance of being polite and maintaining their cars.' WHERE tid = 43;
